# GitHub Actions

A series of GitHub Actions help automate working with the NR Broker.

* [Intention open](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/action-broker-intention-open)
* [Action start](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/action-broker-action-start)
* [Vault login](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/action-broker-vault-login)
* [Vault provision](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/action-broker-vault-provision)
* [Vault token revoke](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/action-broker-vault-revoke)
* [Action end](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/action-broker-action-end)
* [Intention close](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/action-broker-intention-close)

## Linux Scripting

These actions double as a working demonstration of calling the Broker API. The scripts in each to the actions should work on most Linux distributions. You can copy the scripts into a container or onto a Linux server and use them outside of a GitHub action.

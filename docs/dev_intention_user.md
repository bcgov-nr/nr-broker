# Intention User Reference

The user object in the intention must uniquely identify a user in the Broker database. This can be achieved by defining either the id field or both the name and domain fields. As a shortcut, the name field can also specify the domain using an at mark (name@domain).

## Internal users

It is suggested that internal users used for automated processes use the 'internal' domain. See: [Adding Internal Users](/operations_internal_user.md)

# Intention User Reference

The user object in the intention must uniquely identify a user in the Broker database. This can be done by defining the id field or both the name and domain field. The id field should be the name and domain of a user combined using an at mark (name@domain).

## Internal users

It is suggested that internal users used for automated processes use the 'internal' domain. See: [Adding Internal Users](/operations_internal_user.md)
